          Spreadsheets filled with inaccurate hardware data, untraceable users, and constant frustration. A drawer in the office stuffed with outdated devices, abandoned with no plan for further use. New employees excited to join, only to be handed old, less functional equipment.

          Sound familiar?

        <p className="text-lg">
          We've been there, and we've felt the pain. The inefficiency, the waste, and the frustration of managing IT assets in a way that holds businesses and employees back. It's not just about hardware - it's about people, productivity, and potential being lost to outdated processes.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg">
          And let's talk about the financial cost. Without a clear plan and the right tools, you're throwing money away. Unused devices sitting in storage, repair costs for poorly maintained equipment, and time is wasted tracking down who's using what - these inefficiencies add up quickly. Often, businesses opt to buy new devices just to skip the hassle, driving up costs and adding to unnecessary environmental impact. Businesses lose thousands, even tens of thousands, every year to poor IT asset management.
